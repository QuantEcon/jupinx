## Get Started

### Installation

To install `Jupinx`:

```
pip install jupinx
```

to upgrade your current installation to the latest version:

<pre>pip install jupinx --upgrade</pre>


### Quickstart

When starting your own projects a `jupinx-quickstart` is available that will guide you through the initial setup
of a sphinx project that is setup to use the [sphinxcontrib-jupyter](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter)
extension.

Open a terminal and make a folder for your project. Then run:

```
jupinx-quickstart
```

and follow the on-screen questions.

### Advanced Configuration

The quickstart will get you up and running to build Jupyter notebooks. However you may want more advanced control 
of your project. The [sphinxcontrib-jupyter extension](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter) can be
configured to:

#. Enable Notebook Execution (after construction)
#. Enable the construction of a website (from the ipynb collection)
