## Get Started

### Installation

To install the extension:

<pre>pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter</pre>

to upgrade your current installation to the latest version:

<pre>pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter --upgrade</pre>

### Alternative

Another way to get the **latest** version it is to install directly by getting a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter):

<pre>git clone https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter</pre>

and then use

<pre>python setup.py install</pre>

### Developers

For developers it can be useful to install using the <cite>develop</cite> option:

<pre>python setup.py develop</pre>

this will install the package into the <cite>site-wide</cite> package directory which is linked to the code in your local copy of the repository. It is **not** recommended to install this way for common use.

## About the tool

This sphinx extension can be used to build a collection of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks for Sphinx Projects.

One of the main benefits of writing Jupyter notebooks as `RST` files is to simplify the task of version control for large projects.
